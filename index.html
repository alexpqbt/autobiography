              Hello! My full name is <b>Alexandre T. Paquibot</b>. I was 20
              years old when I was writing this. I was born in Lapu-Lapu City,
              and I still live in Lapu-Lapu City. I am the youngest in my family
              of four: my father, mother, sister, and me. I am always the weird
              one in my family. I talk to myself out loud even if they can
              listen to me. Sometimes I randomly sing, laugh, or yell
              unexpectedly. Maybe it's my way of relieving stress, but I'm not
              so sure about that. Aside from my weirdness, I have a different
              physique and am unusually tall compared to them, but the only
              thing that I have in common physically with them is the graying of
              hair and poor eyesight.
            </p>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              I am currently a college student at the
              <b>University of Cebu in Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue</b>, pursuing the
              Bachelor's Science in Information Technology, but let me be frank,
              I was disappointed that they removed the Computer Science program
              since that's what I wanted, but alas, it was notorious for being
              so difficult that the number of students enrolled in that program
              is so small that they dissolved it for this year. The majors I'm
              taking as I was writing were <em>'easy'</em> to me, and I am
              thankful for it because I have more time to focus on the minor
              subjects, but this moment will change in the next semester, and I
              am somewhat excited about them since I'm going to be learning the
              'big boy' stuff but worried that I have no time to focus on the
              other subjects. Oh, and as a side note, I am also a
              <b>working scholar</b> at UC Medical.
            </p>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          So, how do I spend my free time? Like any veteran shut-in introvert, I
          browse through the internet for something mildly entertaining, play
          video games if I feel like it, read books or web novels, listen to any
          music that makes me say,
          <i>"Music is like music to my ears,"</i> practice playing guitar
          <i>(I still suck at it) </i>, lie in my bed, daydreaming and
          occasionally reflecting at myself, want to know why I believe this,
          why I do this, why I behave like that, and so on. Your typical
          introverted life. As far as I can remember, coding and mathematics are
          the only things that I'm passionate about. Things that push my small
          brain to its limits stimulates me, and writing this sentence made me
          think that maybe I am an adrenaline junkie.
        </p>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          To describe my personality, my <em>"personne,"</em> if you will, would
          be biased toward me, so I decided to ask my friend. He said that I am
          introverted but not shy, don't respect social norms, get hyperfixed on
          something, and dig out everything it has until I eventually burn out.
          To expand on the last part, I am currently procrastinating on
          hyperfixation since I am not that bored yet, and speaking of boredom,
          boredom is the final factor to press the accelerator of my interest
          and curiosity. Boredom has led me to unexpected things, like
          programming, cybersecurity, relearning the fundamentals of
          mathematics, guitar, non-fictional books, unorthodox music, etc. To
          describe my <em>"personne,"</em> in my own biased opinion, it would be
          perfectly summed up by the Oxford Dictionary:
          <i>
            "a person with a compulsive desire for excitement and adventure."
          </i>
          I am always looking for things that would appeal to my inner child;
          living in the moment and not worrying about the far future helped me
          endure the cold, uncaring life a little bit.
        </p>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          Once I begin to think about the words like <i>"personne"</i>, I
          started thinking about what's my philosophy in life, so let's talk
          about that. Some of my guiding philosophies in life recently are the
          phrase <i> "It is what it is" </i> and <i>"Carpe diem"</i>. "It is
          what it is" reflects a mindset that is related to certain
          philosophical concepts, such as existentialism and stoicism.
          <b>Existentialism</b> is a philosophy that emphasizes individual
          existence, freedom, and the responsibility of individuals to create
          meaning and purpose in their own lives. <b>Stoicism</b> is a
          philosophy of maintaining inner tranquility and accepting the things
          that are beyond our control. It emphasizes the development of
          self-discipline, virtue, and living in accordance with nature. While
          not a formal philosophy itself, the phrase captures a pragmatic
          approach to accepting circumstances as they are and focusing on our
          response to them rather than resisting or dwelling on them. "Carpe
          diem", which is a Latin for "seize the day". While this phrase is a
          reword for something more <em>'memorable'</em>, the phrase convey a
          resilient mindset in the face of setbacks or failures. It implies a
          willingness to bounce back, learn from experiences, and keep moving
          forward despite obstacles or disappointments.

          >
          a quote that I have made at the top of my mind when I was about to
          answer the question of
          <i> "How do you approach learning and personal growth?" </i> My
          learning has always been spontaneous and informal, like if I see
          something interesting or something in the part of my life that I am
          curious about, I just find a book or any resources that relates to it
          and read it. For example, it was summer and I was laying in bed like
          usual, but I was bored out of my mind, and I thought about how college
          is right around the corner, so I decided to find a book that brushes
          off the dust of my understanding of mathematics and just do it. The
          book was called
          <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25810674-everything-you-need-to-ace-math-in-one-big-fat-notebook?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KbUgfGjmh2&rank=1"

            "Everything You Need to Ace Math in One Big Fat Notebook: The
            Complete Middle School Study Guide" by Altair Peterson</a
          >, and the most memorable thing about reading that book is that when I
          finally reached the last page, I genuinely smiled. I think I smiled
          because I genuinely enjoyed that book and was proud of myself that I
          finished it. I still remember that feeling to this day, and this
          feeling made me pursue reading more books. I am always striving to
          become the better version of yesterday; sometimes I fail to do so, and
          sometimes I succeed, and I am okay with that, failing to reach my
          short goal, sometimes the goal of becoming a better version of myself.
        </p>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          In terms of my favorite books, movies, or pieces of art, my literary
          preferences lean towards the unconventional and informative. I find
          joy in exploring diverse topics, much like my spontaneous approach to
          learning mentioned earlier. Among my favorite books are

          >
            "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind,"
          </a>
          a thought-provoking exploration of the human journey through history,

            >"Jackal Among Snakes,"</a
          >
          a gripping narrative that delves into complex themes. Additionally,

          have secured spots on my list, each contributing to my appreciation
          for immersive and well-crafted fantasy worlds. These novels not only
          provide entertainment but also stimulate my curiosity and imagination.
          In the realm of movies and art, my tastes remain eclectic, favoring
          the unorthodox and thought-provoking in both visual and narrative
          mediums.

        <p class="drop-cap">
          In the short term, my primary goal revolves around a
          <strong> commitment to continuous learning </strong>, aspiring to
          absorb new knowledge and skills on a daily basis. This involves
          cultivating a habit of curiosity and exploration, whether it be
          through reading, online courses, or practical experiences. I aim to
          diversify my understanding of various subjects, embracing a
          multidisciplinary approach to personal development. This short-term
          goal aligns with my belief that each day offers an opportunity for
          growth and discovery, reinforcing the idea that knowledge is an
          ever-expanding horizon. Looking towards the long term, my overarching
          goal is a continuous journey of self-improvement. This involves not
          only acquiring new knowledge but also applying it in practical ways to
          enhance different facets of my life. I aim to evolve into a more
          resilient, adaptable, and well-rounded individual, not only in my
          academic pursuits but also in my personal and professional endeavors.
          This long-term goal reflects a
          <strong> commitment to becoming the best version of myself </strong>,
          recognizing that improvement is an ongoing process that spans a
          lifetime. I envision a future where the accumulation of knowledge,
          experiences, and personal growth contributes to a fulfilling and
          meaningful life journey.
        </p>

        <p class="drop-cap">
          When it comes to core values, the philosophies of
          <i>"It is what it is"</i> and <i>"Carpe diem"</i> continue to shape my
          outlook on life, emphasizing acceptance of circumstances and a
          resilient mindset. Additionally, I hold <strong>privacy</strong> as a
          fundamental value, acknowledging the importance of personal boundaries
          and the need to safeguard sensitive information. It's worth noting
          that in certain situations, the pursuit of academic or professional
          goals may lead me to navigate the fine line between privacy and
          necessity. There may be instances where, for the sake of those
          numerical metrics that influence my future, I find myself compromising
          elements of my privacy. It's a conscious decision, one that may
          challenge my personal boundaries and evoke a sense of discomfort.
          Despite any internal conflict, I recognize the intrinsic value derived
          from these compromises, emphasizing the complex interplay between
          individual privacy, societal expectations, and the pursuit of personal
          and academic success.

        <p class="drop-cap">
          Reflecting on achievements, one that stands out is my
          <i> rekindled passion for mathematics </i> and
          <i> perseverance through a challenging programming course </i> through
          self-directed learning. The completion of the mathematics study guide
          mentioned earlier marked a significant accomplishment for me, evoking
          genuine pride and a sense of personal growth. Embracing the challenges
          posed by academia and my own quirks, I navigate the maze of
          unconventional thoughts and spontaneous pursuits with the
          understanding that each step contributes to my mosaic of achievements
          and failures, shaping the unique tapestry of my journey through life.
          The challenging course required repeated attempts to grasp the
          intricate concepts, and despite the difficulties, I tenaciously
          pressed on until I achieved a comprehensive understanding. The process
          of gritting through the course showcased not only my determination but
          also my commitment to mastering complex subjects. This achievement
          symbolizes my willingness to confront challenges head-on, learn from
          setbacks, and ultimately triumph over adversity. It serves as a
          testament to my resilience and dedication to the pursuit of knowledge,
          reinforcing my belief in the value of persistence in the face of
          intellectual challenges.

          Yes! Finally, I am done with this essay. Thank goodness. Anyway, In
          conclusion, my journey through life as Alexandre T. Paquibot is a
          tapestry woven with the threads of uniqueness, curiosity, and a
          relentless pursuit of personal growth. Born and raised in Lapu-Lapu
          City, I embrace my role as the eccentric member of a family of four,
          characterized by my quirky behaviors and physical differences. As a
          college student at the University of Cebu, my disappointment in the
          removal of the Computer Science program has evolved into an excitement
          for the challenges that lie ahead in Information Technology. Balancing
          my studies with work as a scholar at UC Medical, I navigate the
          complexities of academia with a mixture of enthusiasm and concern.

        <p>
          My free time is a haven for introverted activities, from browsing the
          internet to practicing guitar and pondering the intricacies of life.
          Coding and mathematics serve as my passionate outlets, pushing the
          limits of my intellect and hinting at a possible adrenaline-seeking
          nature within me. Describing my "personne," I embrace the compulsive
          desire for excitement and adventure, always seeking experiences that
          appeal to my inner child.
        </p>

        <p>
          Philosophically, I adhere to the pragmatic mindset of "It is what it

          reflect a blend of existentialism and stoicism, shaping my outlook on
          acceptance, inner tranquility, and the pursuit of personal meaning.
          Realizations, like puzzle pieces falling into perfect alignment, mark
          my approach to learning and personal growth—an inherently spontaneous
          and informal journey that involves exploring interests, such as the
          rekindling of my passion for mathematics.
        </p>

        <p>
          My favorite books, movies, and art lean towards the unconventional,
          with a penchant for informative and thought-provoking works.
          Short-term goals revolve around a commitment to daily learning, while
          long-term aspirations center on a continuous journey of
          self-improvement—becoming a more resilient and well-rounded
          individual. Core values include acceptance, resilience, and privacy,
          with a conscious acknowledgment that compromises may be made for the
          sake of academic or professional pursuits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Achievements are not just about reaching summits but also navigating
          through challenging courses, such as programming, with perseverance
          and determination. Each accomplishment, whether completing a book or
          mastering a complex subject, contributes to the mosaic of my
          unconventional yet fulfilling journey through the tapestry of life. In
          essence, I find solace and fulfillment in the uniqueness of my quirks
          and the uncharted territories of my interests, embracing both
          successes and failures as integral parts of my continuous quest for
          personal and intellectual growth.

              something mentally stimulating.

                Virtuosos, comprising about five percent of the population, are
                hands-on explorers driven by a blend of cool rationalism and
                spirited curiosity. Natural Makers, often found in roles like
                mechanics and engineers, they derive immense joy from
                dismantling and reconstructing things, always seeking to
                improve. Their approach to ideas is practical, rooted in
                troubleshooting, trial and error, and firsthand experience.
                While they appreciate sharing their projects and knowledge, they
                value their principles and freedom, welcoming others into their
                space as long as there's no interference.

                Yes, it's pretty accurate that I'm beginning to suspect that
                there's some psychological trick used to elicit this kind of
                response from me. Every point that this

                made made me say, <i>"This is literally me for real."</i> I
                can't find anything that I disagree with, and again, I say, it's
                accurate that it's eerie.

                <i>Sadness</i>, <i>moodiness</i>, and
                <i>emotional instability</i> are characteristics of
                <b>neuroticism</b>. Individuals with high neuroticism are prone
                to mood fluctuations, anxiety, impatience, and unhappiness.
                Those with low levels of this personality trait are more stable
                and emotionally resilient.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Extraversion</b> is a personality attribute that is
                characterized by <i>excitability</i>, <i>friendliness</i>,
                <i>talkativeness</i>, <i>assertiveness</i>, and a high level of
                <i>emotional expressiveness</i>. Extraverts are gregarious and
                tend to gain energy in social situations. Being in the company
                of others makes them feel invigorated and excited. People that
                are introverted or have a low level of this personality trait
                are more reserved. They have less energy to expend in social
                situations, and social gatherings can be exhausting. Introverts
                frequently require alone and silence in order to "recharge."
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Openness</b> stresses imagination and insight the most.
                People with a high level of openness tend to have a diverse set
                of interests. They are fascinated by the world and other people,
                and they are ready to learn new things and have new experiences.
                People with a high level of this personality trait are also more
                daring and innovative. People that score low on this personality
                feature tend to be more traditional and may struggle with
                abstract thinking.

                <i>Trust</i>, <i>altruism</i>, <i>friendliness</i>,
                <i>affection</i>, and other prosocial acts are examples of
                <b>agreeableness</b>. People with high agreeableness tend to be
                more cooperative, whereas those with low agreeableness tend to
                be more competitive, and sometimes even manipulative.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Conscientiousness</b> is characterized by forethought,
                <i> good impulse control </i>, and
                <i>goal-directed behavior</i>. Highly conscientious people are
                structured and detail-oriented. They plan ahead of time,
                consider how their actions influence others, and keep deadlines
                in mind. Someone with a lower score on this key personality
                attribute is less ordered and orderly. They may postpone in
                order to finish tasks, sometimes entirely missing deadlines.

                Somewhat, I am satisfied with the result of the test although
                there are some questions that are highly dependent on context
                that I just answered 'sometimes'. There are some percentages
                that I don't agree to.
