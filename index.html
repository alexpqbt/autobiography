              Hello! My full name is <b>Alexandre T. Paquibot</b>. I was 20
              years old when I was writing this. I was born in Lapu-Lapu City,
              and I still live in Lapu-Lapu City. I am the youngest in my family
              of four: my father, mother, sister, and me. I am always the weird
              one in my family. I talk to myself out loud even if they can
              listen to me. Sometimes I randomly sing, laugh, or yell
              unexpectedly. Maybe it's my way of relieving stress, but I'm not
              so sure about that. Aside from my weirdness, I have a different
              physique and am unusually tall compared to them, but the only
              thing that I have in common physically with them is the graying of
              hair and poor eyesight.
            </p>
            <p class="drop-cap">
              I am currently a college student at the
              <b>University of Cebu in Lapu-Lapu and Mandaue</b>, pursuing the
              Bachelor's Science in Information Technology, but let me be frank,
              I was disappointed that they removed the Computer Science program
              since that's what I wanted, but alas, it was notorious for being
              so difficult that the number of students enrolled in that program
              is so small that they dissolved it for this year. The majors I'm
              taking as I was writing were <em>'easy'</em> to me, and I am
              thankful for it because I have more time to focus on the minor
              subjects, but this moment will change in the next semester, and I
              am somewhat excited about them since I'm going to be learning the
              'big boy' stuff but worried that I have no time to focus on the
              other subjects. Oh, and as a side note, I am also a
              <b>working scholar</b> at UC Medical.

          So, how do I spend my free time? Like any veteran shut-in introvert, I
          browse through the internet for something mildly entertaining, play
          video games if I feel like it, read books or web novels, listen to any
          music that makes me say,
          <i>"Music is like music to my ears,"</i> practice playing guitar
          <i>(I still suck at it) </i>, lie in my bed, daydreaming and
          occasionally reflecting at myself, want to know why I believe this,
          why I do this, why I behave like that, and so on. Your typical
          introverted life. As far as I can remember, coding and mathematics are
          the only things that I'm passionate about. Things that push my small
          brain to its limits stimulates me, and writing this sentence made me
          think that maybe I am an adrenaline junkie.
        </p>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          To describe my personality, my <em>"personne,"</em> if you will, would
          be biased toward me, so I decided to ask my friend. He said that I am
          introverted but not shy, don't respect social norms, get hyperfixed on
          something, and dig out everything it has until I eventually burn out.
          To expand on the last part, I am currently procrastinating on
          hyperfixation since I am not that bored yet, and speaking of boredom,
          boredom is the final factor to press the accelerator of my interest
          and curiosity. Boredom has led me to unexpected things, like
          programming, cybersecurity, relearning the fundamentals of
          mathematics, guitar, non-fictional books, unorthodox music, etc. To
          describe my <em>"personne,"</em> in my own biased opinion, it would be
          perfectly summed up by the Oxford Dictionary:
          <i>
            "a person with a compulsive desire for excitement and adventure."
          </i>
          I am always looking for things that would appeal to my inner child;
          living in the moment and not worrying about the far future helped me
          endure the cold, uncaring life a little bit.
        </p>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          Once I begin to think about the words like <i>"personne"</i>, I
          started thinking about what's my philosophy in life, so let's talk
          about that. Some of my guiding philosophies in life recently are the
          phrase <i> "It is what it is" </i> and <i>"Carpe diem"</i>. "It is
          what it is" reflects a mindset that is related to certain
          philosophical concepts, such as existentialism and stoicism.
          <b>Existentialism</b> is a philosophy that emphasizes individual
          existence, freedom, and the responsibility of individuals to create
          meaning and purpose in their own lives. <b>Stoicism</b> is a
          philosophy of maintaining inner tranquility and accepting the things
          that are beyond our control. It emphasizes the development of
          self-discipline, virtue, and living in accordance with nature. While
          not a formal philosophy itself, the phrase captures a pragmatic
          approach to accepting circumstances as they are and focusing on our
          response to them rather than resisting or dwelling on them. "Carpe
          diem", which is a Latin for "seize the day". While this phrase is a
          reword for something more <em>'memorable'</em>, the phrase convey a
          resilient mindset in the face of setbacks or failures. It implies a
          willingness to bounce back, learn from experiences, and keep moving
          forward despite obstacles or disappointments.

            >ealization clicks like a puzzle piece falling into perfect
            alignment,"</i
          >
          a quote that I have made at the top of my mind when I was about to
          answer the question of
          <i> "How do you approach learning and personal growth?" </i> My
          learning has always been spontaneous and informal, like if I see
          something interesting or something in the part of my life that I am
          curious about, I just find a book or any resources that relates to it
          and read it. For example, it was summer and I was laying in bed like
          usual, but I was bored out of my mind, and I thought about how college
          is right around the corner, so I decided to find a book that brushes
          off the dust of my understanding of mathematics and just do it. The
          book was called
          <a
            href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25810674-everything-you-need-to-ace-math-in-one-big-fat-notebook?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=KbUgfGjmh2&rank=1"
          >
            "Everything You Need to Ace Math in One Big Fat Notebook: The
            Complete Middle School Study Guide" by Altair Peterson</a
          >, and the most memorable thing about reading that book is that when I
          finally reached the last page, I genuinely smiled. I think I smiled
          because I genuinely enjoyed that book and was proud of myself that I
          finished it. I still remember that feeling to this day, and this
          feeling made me pursue reading more books. I am always striving to
          become the better version of yesterday; sometimes I fail to do so, and
          sometimes I succeed, and I am okay with that, failing to reach my
          short goal, sometimes the goal of becoming a better version of myself.
        </p>
        <p class="drop-cap">
          Yes! Finally, I am done with this essay. Thank goodness. Anyway, in
          conclusion, as I reflect on my journey, I find solace in the
          uniqueness of my quirks and the uncharted territories of my interests.
          My days are a blend of unconventional thoughts, spontaneous pursuits,
          and the constant hum of curiosity. I navigate the maze of academia, my
          disappointment in the absence of the computer science program
          metamorphosing into anticipation for the challenges ahead. I embrace
          the dichotomy of my introverted yet not shy persona, a paradox that
          propels me into hyperfixations until I inevitably burn out. Boredom
          becomes the catalyst for my ventures into programming, cybersecurity,
          relearning mathematics, and the strings of a guitar. My philosophy
          encapsulates the pragmatism of "It is what it is" and the resilience
          of "Carpe diem," weaving existentialist and stoic threads into the
          fabric of my mindset. Life's puzzle pieces click into place with each
          realization—a continual process of seizing the day and seeking
          excitement and adventure. My approach to learning mirrors the
          spontaneity of my interests, with each book or resource being a
          stepping stone in my quest for personal growth. As I pursue the better
          version of myself, I embrace both success and failure, recognizing
          that each step shapes the mosaic of my unconventional yet fulfilling
          journey through the tapestry of life.

                A Virtuoso (ISTP) is someone who is Introverted, Observant,
                Thinking, and Prospecting. They have an autonomous perspective
                and pursue goals without much external connection. They approach
                life with curiosity and personal skill, altering their approach
                as needed.

                  the same job. I wanted interesting challenges.

                Virtuosos, comprising about five percent of the population, are
                hands-on explorers driven by a blend of cool rationalism and
                spirited curiosity. Natural Makers, often found in roles like
                mechanics and engineers, they derive immense joy from
                dismantling and reconstructing things, always seeking to
                improve. Their approach to ideas is practical, rooted in
                troubleshooting, trial and error, and firsthand experience.
                While they appreciate sharing their projects and knowledge, they
                value their principles and freedom, welcoming others into their
                space as long as there's no interference.

                Sadness, moodiness, and emotional instability are
                characteristics of neuroticism. Individuals with high
                neuroticism are prone to mood fluctuations, anxiety, impatience,
                and unhappiness. Those with low levels of this personality trait
                are more stable and emotionally resilient.
              </p>
              <p>
                Extraversion is a personality attribute that is characterized by
                excitability, friendliness, talkativeness, assertiveness, and a
                high level of emotional expressiveness. Extraverts are
                gregarious and tend to gain energy in social situations. Being
                in the company of others makes them feel invigorated and
                excited. People that are introverted or have a low level of this
                personality trait are more reserved. They have less energy to
                expend in social situations, and social gatherings can be
                exhausting. Introverts frequently require alone and silence in
                order to "recharge."
              </p>
              <p>
                Out of the five personality qualities, openness stresses
                imagination and insight the most. People with a high level of
                openness tend to have a diverse set of interests. They are
                fascinated by the world and other people, and they are ready to
                learn new things and have new experiences. People with a high
                level of this personality trait are also more daring and
                innovative. People that score low on this personality feature
                tend to be more traditional and may struggle with abstract
                thinking.
              </p>
              <p>
                Trust, altruism, friendliness, affection, and other prosocial
                acts are examples of agreeableness. People with high
                agreeableness tend to be more cooperative, whereas those with
                low agreeableness tend to be more competitive, and sometimes
                even manipulative.
              </p>
              <p>
                Conscientiousness is characterized by forethought, good impulse
                control, and goal-directed behavior. Highly conscientious people
                are structured and detail-oriented. They plan ahead of time,
                consider how their actions influence others, and keep deadlines
                in mind. Someone with a lower score on this key personality
                attribute is less ordered and orderly. They may postpone in
                order to finish tasks, sometimes entirely missing deadlines.
